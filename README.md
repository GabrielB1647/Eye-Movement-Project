# Eye-Movement-Project

In this project, the user is able to create two eyes on the screen which follow the track of the cursor.  This project is very interesting as it brings together key concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Road Map of Future Improvements: In the future, I would like to play with adding more two eyes, as well as changing sizes and colors.  Another interesting change would be to add pictures or graphics instead of eyes and to play with the follow the cursor concept.    

## How to Run:  
- Launch index.html
- Move cursor around broswer window to see eyes follow the cursor.
